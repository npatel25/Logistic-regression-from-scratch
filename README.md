# Building a Logistic Regression Model from scratch in Python

Things covered in this exercise:
* Built a logistic regession classsifier from scratch on a real world dataset in python without using scikit learn.
* This covers all the preprocessing steps required on this dataset before feeding it to logistic regression model.
* How to handle categorical variables.
* How to handle class imbalance.
* Build a logisitc regression model from scratch with gradient descent.
* Finally, compare the results to scikit learn logistic regression algorithm.
